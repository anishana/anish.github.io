It has been several years since blogging took the world by storm. And it has progressed from being a way to just put down your thoughts for the world to read to being an entirely new way to view the world.

I think it is time I started to write down my thoughts too. Let me start by introducing myself. I am Ameya Joshi, second year undergraduate at BITS Pilani,Â  Goa Campus, currently pursuing B.E.(Hons.) Electronics and Electrical Engineering.

Currently, I am engaged in a tussle with one of the most popular fields of computing in recent times- Artificial Intelligence. I actually got introduced to this field through Image Processing, another emerging area of computing. I am currently pursuing my interests in these fields and this blog will be a record of my work in them.
