2. assurekit.com

    * assurekit.com is a one-stop insurance gateway
    * It is a powerful tool for the insurers to create any form, workflow with help of React and unstructured database like MongoDB.
    * It includes a variety of payment gateway integration so that the customers can pay the insurance premium on the go.
    * In addition to the functional side of the gateway, assurekit includes statistical analysis and graphs of various insurance policies and their customers so that the customer receives a better deal.
    * Assurekit’s modular structure can be used to create an ERP or a CRM system on the fly.
    * assurekit.com uses React for the front-end, MongoDB, Redis, and MySQL for database, and Java for the backend.
    * A CI/CD(Continuous integration, continuous deployment) structure is implemented for smooth deployment.

    * Taco DB consists of the ability to execute all the database queries right from a simple select query, to complex nested queries.

2. Distributed System for Student Gateway using RAFT consensus
    * Created a portal to service students with their grades, and course selection.
    * This application implements a highly rated consensus algorithm called Raft Consensus for the replication of logs and keeping a track of all the database entries and updates in real-time to maintain a continuous, fault-tolerant environment.

    * Co-developed the models used to predict the labels for the handwritten MNIST dataset with an average of around 98.5% accuracy.
    * Created visualizations using matlibplot and seaborn to indicate various accuracy measures.
    * All the work in the project was done in Python.
    * [Github](https://github.com/anishana/Text-Recognition-on-a-MNIST-dataset "Github")

4. Chat Application Using sockets

    * Built a chat application using client and server architecture.
    * Used client and server sockets to create a chat application which helped us communicate between 2 or more clients over the network.
    * Constructed a provision for a user to enter few shell commands to get certain results like IP, Port, list of logged-in clients.
    * Included a broadcast system that broadcasts messages to all the logged-in clients.
    * Created a storage for the messages intended to the logged-out clients which were sent once the client logged in to the server.
    * This chat application is written in C for greater control of the chat application.
    * [Github](https://github.com/anishana/Chat-application-using-socket-programming "Github")

5. Pintos

    * Pintos is an instructional OS.
    * Created a priority scheduling algorithm and a Multilevel feedback queue system for scheduling threads.
    * Implemented various system calls that can be used by user programs.
    * It implements priority donation for the newer threads to get the control of the system.
    * All the thread synchronisation is done using semaphores and locks.
    * Pintos is written in C implementing various structures like list.

6. Online Admission and Fee System

    * Designed and developed an ERP Solution for online fee and admission management systems.
    * A robust system to manage the college’s fee management and admission system and convert it from a tedious offline process to an easy stress-free online process.
    * The project was implemented using Spring MVC, MySQL, jQuery, JSP, Bootstrap.
