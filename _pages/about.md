I am a Masters student at the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, The State University of New York at Buffalo. My primary areas of work are creating applications for SaaS-based companies using languages like Java, JavaScript and tapping into various libraries and frameworks like SpringBoot, Node.js, React.js, Express.js. 



<!-- I am a PhD student at NYU Tandon, being advised by [Dr. Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io/). I was previously a PhD student at Iowa State University (2018-2019) with Dr. Hegde and [Dr. Soumik Sarkar](http://web.me.iastate.edu/soumiks////principal-investigator.html). My primary research areas are **Robust Learning of deep neural models** and **Generative models with structured constraints**. I graduated with Bachelors(Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani, Goa in 2014.

I interned at Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI), Pittsburgh under the supervision of [Dr. Leonid Boytsov](http://searchivarius.org/about) and [Dr. Filippe Condessa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipe-condessa-86a41730/) in the summer of 2021 where I worked on Randomized Smoothing for Video Classifiers. 


I used to be a Lead Computer Scientist at [Sigtuple Inc.](www.sigtuple.com) and worked on learning based systems for medical images (retinal and radiological).
